-The 'Unit-03-12-24.csv' file is the cuurent export from WW that i received. Need to fix the columns on the app
-'PC-03-12-24.xls' is a report that can be pulled from WW that has non-serialized items and serialized.
- - Issue is that the serialized items don't show the serial/unit numbers
- - Also I'm not sure why the file has 'Quantity' and 'Counts' columns. That have different numbers.
- - - Available vs stock?
- - - The count coulmn might be a way to tell if it is serialized or not. The WW export has a blue square in the cell, but that won't be useful when the file is changed to CSV
- - I think it could be possible to use both files to scan the whole warehouse with the app.
- - - Logic idea below - - -
- Parse PC file to make PC List
- - { Catefory: string, Part Number: string, , Description: string, , Location: string, , Quantity: int (or count), serialized: boolean, serialNumbers: array}
- Parse Unit file to make Unit List
- - {Inventory Part: string, , Serial #: string, , (Unit No): string, , Unit Description: }
-Loop the Unit list 
- - If the UnitList.Inventory Part is in PCList.Part Number
- - - Add the UnitList.Serial# / (Unit No) to PCList.serialNumbers[]
- - - Remove item from UnitList
- Add the remaining items to PC List ?
- - Might be redundant since the UnitList looks like a sub table of PC List

- At this point the WW files can be used with the scanned file. Need to track the expected and scanned quantites in the PC list array.
